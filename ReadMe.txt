This program was run using Java 24 and MySQL Workbench.


Setup

Unzip the program folder and open in your favorite Java IDE. IntelliJ works well.

To run the program first start MySQL Workbench and get a running instance of a server on your computer.
Note the user, password, and port that you select.

Go to the file /src/db/Database.

At the top of the file you must change the 3 strings password, user, port to match your configuration.

Once you have done that compile and run the program.

The first time you run the program it will come to the main menu.

Select 1. To seed the database.

From there you can select whatever item you want from the menu to conduct insert, update, delete, and querying functionalities.
